NOTE: There is no current implementation for sensory input in the code. This will be added in the coming weeks.
      The goal is to use sensory input to start various functions on the bot. The client has not specified
      the desired functions. 
      
      
To use the bot:

    Step 1: Clone the respository. 
    
    Step 2: Open the Instruction PDF and build the bot to the specifications
    
    Step 3: Download the Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
    
    Step 4: Open the file called SparkMaconRobot.INO. This will automatically launch the Arduino IDE.
    
    Step 5: Plug the Arduino into the computer using the proper USB cable.
    
    Step 6: Under the "Tools" tab in the Arduino IDE, navigate to "Board" and select Arduino/Genuino 
            Uno.
    
    Step 7: Under the "Tools" tab in the Arduino IDE, navigate to "Port" and select appropriate port.
    
    Step 8: Upload the code to the arduino after making any desired changes. To upload, first select 
            the check mark under "file" to check for compilation errors. Fix any errors that arise. 
            Then, select the rigt arrow next to the check mark to upload the code.
            
    Step 9: Unplug the Arduino from the computer.
    
    Step 10: Plug the Arduino into the portable battery pack. The code will automatically run.
